abstract = {The future Internet will embrace the intelligence of Web 3.0 and the omnipresence of every day connected objects. The later was envisioned as the Internet of Things. Security and interoperability concerns are hindering the service innovations using the Internet of Things. This paper addresses secure access provision to Internet of Things-enabled services and interoperability of security attributes between different administrative domains. In this paper we proposed a layered architecture of Internet of Things framework where a semantically enhanced overlay interlink the other layers and facilitate secure access provision to Internet of Things-enabled services. The main element of semantic overlay is security reasoning through ontologies and semantic rules. Finally the interoperability of security aspect is addressed through ontology and a machine-to-machine platform. This paper provides implementation details of security reasoning and the interoperability aspects and discusses crucial challenges in these areas.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the Internet of Things. Main enabling factor of this promising paradigm is the integration of several technologies and communications solutions. Identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols (shared with the Next Generation Internet), and distributed intelligence for smart objects are just the most relevant. As one can easily imagine, any serious contribution to the advance of the Internet of Things must necessarily be the result of synergetic activities conducted in different fields of knowledge, such as telecommunications, informatics, electronics and social science. In such a complex scenario, this survey is directed to those who want to approach this complex discipline and contribute to its development. Different visions of this Internet of Things paradigm are reported and enabling technologies reviewed. What emerges is that still major issues shall be faced by the research community. The most relevant among them are addressed in details. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things and Services is a rapidly growing concept that illustrates that the ever increasing amount of physical items of our daily life which become addressable through a network could be made more easily manageable and usable through the use of Services. This surge of exposed resources along with the level of privacy and value of the information they hold, together with the increase of their usage make for an augmentation in the number of the security threats and violation attempts that existing security systems do not appear robust enough to address. In this paper, the authors underline this increase in risk and identify the requirements for resources to be more resilient in this type of environment while keeping an important level of flexibility. In addition, the authors propose an architectural model of Self Managed Security Cell, which leverages on current knowledge in large scale security systems, information management and autonomous systems.},

Although the security needs are well-recognized in this domain, it is still not fully understood how existing IP security protocols and architectures can be deployed. In this paper, we discuss the applicability and limitations of existing Internet protocols and secu- rity architectures in the context of the Internet of Things. First, we give an overview of the deployment model and general security needs.We then present challenges and requirements for IP-based security solutions and highlight specific technical limitations of standard IP security protocols.

Alternatively, distributed architectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicability and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and disadvantages - not only in terms of features but also in terms of security and privacy challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) consists of several tiny devices connected together to form a collaborative computing environment. IoT imposes peculiar constraints in terms of connectivity, computational power and energy budget, which make it significantly different from those contemplated by the canonical doctrine of security in distributed systems. In order to circumvent the problem of security in IoT domain, networks and devices need to be secured. In this paper, we consider the embedded device security only, assuming that network security is properly in place. It can be noticed that the existence of tiny computing devices that form ubiquity in IoT domain are very much vulnerable to different security attacks. In this work, we provide the requirements of embedded security, the solutions to resists different attacks and the technology for resisting temper proofing of the embedded devices by the concept of trusted computing. Our paper attempts to address the issue of security for data at rest. Addressing this issue is equivalent to addressing the security issue of the hardware platform. Our work also partially helps in addressing securing data in transit.},
